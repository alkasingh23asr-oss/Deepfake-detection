# Deepfake-detection
Deepfake Detection is a machine learning project that identifies manipulated images or videos created using AI. It uses CNN or hybrid models to detect visual artifacts, facial inconsistencies, and temporal anomalies. The system classifies media as real or fake, helping prevent misinformation, fraud, and digital identity misuse.
